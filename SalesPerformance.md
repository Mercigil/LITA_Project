### Project Overview 
I am working on my LITA Project (Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store) where I will analysis Sales Performance  for a Retail Store.I explored sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. 

---
### Data Source
The Data (LITA_ProjectSaleData1.csv) was given by LITA team (Incubator Hub) on the learning platform (Canvas for Infrastructure) as an excel file.

---
### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
- SQL Server Management Studio for Querying and Analyzing Data [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- Power BI for Data Visualizations [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

---
### Data Cleaning and Preparartions
The following was done to prepare our data for Analysis and Query
- Downloading of data from LITA LMS (Canvas) so as to be used in Ms-Excel for data cleaning and Data Analysis 
- Opening of Data in Excel to Clean Dataset;
  1. Freezing Header Row
  2. Formatting Data as Table
  3. Checking for Blank Cells or Rows (None was found)
  4. Checking that each Row had the right Datatype
  5. Checking for Duplicate Rows
     - Downloaded Dataset had 50001 Rows including Header Rows
     - 40079 Duplicate Rows found and Removed
     - Cleaned Dataset left with 9921 Rows including Header Rows
  6. Added a Calcuated Column (Revenue) as Quantity Sold * Unitprice
- Copy data and opened in a New Workbook and saved it as a "csv" file so as to be imported into SQL Server Mangement Studio  and Power BI for Data Analysis and Data visualizations
- While importing Sales dataset into SQL Server Mangement Studio, "tinyint" and "smallint" data types were changed to "int"
- Open Cleaned dataset csv file using Power BI to extract add new column to dataset from OrderDate Column:
  1. Added Column Year
  2. Added Column Month Name
  3. Added Column Quarter

---
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involues exploring dataset to answer some question such as;
- What are the Top-Selling Products?
- What are the Regional Performance?
- Are there Monthly sales trends?

---

### Recommendation
 The team in charge of making product available should 
 1. Look into the product that are in high demand and ensure they are available always
 2. Look into the region that are in high demand, as manay orders could be merge on one delivery trip
 3. Look into the months that product are in high demand in regions so as to know when to stock product and which to stock.
