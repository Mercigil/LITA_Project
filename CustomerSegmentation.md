### Project Overview 
I am working on my LITA Project (Customer Segmentation) where I will analysis customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. 

---
### Data Source
The Data (LITA_Project_CustomerData.csv) was given by LITA team (Incubator Hub) on the learning platform (Canvas for Infrastructure) as an excel file.

---
### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
- SQL Server Management Studio for Querying and Analyzing Data [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- Power BI for Data Visualizations [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

---
### Data Cleaning and Preparartions
The following was done to prepare our data for Analysis and Query
- Downloading of data from LITA LMS (Canvas) so as to be used in Ms-Excel for data cleaning and Data Analysis 
- Opening of Data in Excel to Clean Dataset;
  1. Freezing Header Row
  2. Formatting Data as Table
  3. Checking for Blank Cells or Rows (None was found)
  4. Checking that each Row had the right Datatype
  5. Checking for Duplicate Rows
     - Downloaded Dataset had 75001 Rows including Header Rows
     - 41213 Duplicate Rows found and Removed
     - Cleaned Dataset left with 33787 Rows including Header Rows
  6. Added a Calcuated Column (SubscriptionDuration) as SubscriptionEnd - SubscriptionStart
- Copy data and opened in a New Workbook and saved it as a "csv" file so as to be imported into SQL Server Mangement Studio  and Power BI for Data Analysis and Data visualizations
- While importing Sales dataset into SQL Server Mangement Studio, "tinyint" and "smallint" data types were changed to "int" and Revenue column dataype was changed from "tinyint" to "real'

---
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involues exploring dataset to answer some question such as;
- What are the Customer Behavior?
- What are the Track Subscription Types?
- What are the key trends in cancellations and renewals?

---
### Data Analysis using MS-Excel
Using Microsoft Excel pivot table, the following summarization of the Customer data was obtained

### Conclusion
The following are my insight got form the data analysis,data query and data visualization
- Basic Subscription Type is the most subscribed based on No of Subscribers and Total Revenue
- East Region has more subscribers based on No of Subscribers and Total Revenue (although the difference with other Region isnt so much)
- No of Subcribers reduces with year
- Revenue from Canceled Subscription is higher compared to that of Active Subscription
- Lots of Subcribers are cancelling their subscription
- East and North regions patronize Basic Subscription Type
- East and North regions patronize Basic Subscription Type
- South region patronize Premium Subscription Type
- West region patronize Standard Subscription Type

---
### Challenge
While Analyzing the data, at subscription duration, every customer is having 365 or 366 day which is a year. 

This should not be the case as Customer with Sucscription Cancelation Status as True should have their subscrition duration as less than a year.

Using the SubscriptionStart and SubscriptionEnd given, the subscription duration always ends up as a year no matter how i tired.

This challenge limited my analysis as I could find any month/year related insight.
